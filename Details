Recap:

    what is node, npm,
    node - isolated 

    what is react
      framework used to single-page application --> single html file and further pages are loaded with DOM manipulation with help of virtual

    what is VirtualDOM:
      in memory copy of the actual DOM
      changes reflect first in VDOM
      where the VDOM is compared with Actual DOM
      Rendering heppens only when there is a difference in Comparison

    Conditional rendering 
    
    Components

    Props

Topics:
  Components:
    are the functional/building blocks ( Constructs Separate UI (JSX) block )

    while writing component follow the below,

      filename and component shoudl be same

      default export for component

      Name of the component/ file name should be Capitalised.
        eg: CardBtn - Card component which behaves like button
            Course - represents a course block
      
      wrong:
        cardbtn - wrong
        course - wrong
  
  Stop the react server:
    goto running terminal
    ctrl + c

  Working with array lists
    {} --> using expression or js statements inside jsx
    rendering a array of data

    error, warning in compilation

    should correct the warning and errors

    Usage of keys:
      key is specified to identify the particular component in VDOM
      do not use index key

  for in html --> htmlFor in jsx ( for is a reserved keyword )
  class in html --> className in jsx ( class is reserved keyword in js )

  conditional rendering:
    conditional changing the ui

  <></> --> fragment for wrapping a set of html elements/components

  Rendering:
    when VDOM and Actual DOM is Loaded, the variable and other declarations ( var, let, const ) made const.
  Default React behavior:
    Once rendered DOM or VDOM will **not** render as long we refresh
  
  Overcoming:
    React has one utility called hooks --> provides a re-render
    useState --> state handling

  Props vs state
    Props:
      A static data passed to a component while rendering at once
    State:
      useState is a hook
      Data changes causes re-render

  Handling Events:
    onClick
